Question:
What is the difference between a physical and a virtual address? 

Answer:
A physical address is the real address or location which is computed by the MMU, while a virtual address is the abstract or logical memory which is generated by the CPU to help because the physical address is not large enough.

We need to translate and map these virtual addresses to the physical addresses.

Also, the virtual address can be viewed and accessed by the user, but the physical cannot be viewed by the user or directly accessed by the user.
