Sequence for increased Hit/Miss ratio:

Hit = 147; Miss = 3; Hit/Miss ratio = 49.0;
Reason: The more we reference page numbers which we recently just made use of, the more likeliness of a hit, which in turn will produce a high Hit/Miss ratio. This is based on locality of reference.

Sequence for decreased Hit/Miss ratio:

Hit = 14; Miss = 192; Hit/Miss ratio = 0.072917;
Reason: The more we reference new pages, not already present in the page frame, the more likeliness of a miss, which in turn will produce low Hit/Miss ratio. This is also based on locality of reference.
